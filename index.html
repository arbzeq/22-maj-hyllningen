            <h2>King of Reunited Gondor and Arnor</h2>
            <p>Following the defeat of Sauron and the deaths of Elendil, Anarion, and Isildur, Anarion's son, Meneldil,
            became king of Gondor and Isildur's son, Valandil, became king of Arnor. Many years later, the kingdom
            of Arnor was lost in battle with the evil land of Angmar, and Arvedui, the king of Arnor, died in a
            shipwreck. After that, the line of the kings of Arnor was maintained by the Chieftains of the DÃºnedain,
            who were raised in Rivendell. The kingdom of Gondor continued, but years later, after the childless King
            Earnur was lost, Gondor was ruled by stewards. Eventually, Sauron returned to the land of Mordor and
            openly declared himself. Each Chieftain was given a name with the Kingly prefix of Ar(a)-, to
            signify his right to the Kingship of Arnor.</p>
            <h4>He did the following great deeds during his life:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Escorted the hobbits</li>
                <li>Tried to rescue Merry and Pippin</li>
                <li>Returned as a king!</li>
            </ul>
